## Exercise 1

Write a JavaScript program to print out all even numbers from a given Array in the same order and stop printing when it finds 237 in the sequence.

Sample numbers list:

```js
let numbers = [
    386,
    462,
    47,
    418,
    907,
    344,
    236,
    375,
    823,
    566,
    597,
    978,
    328,
    615,
    953,
    345,
    399,
    162,
    758,
    219,
    918,
    237,
    412,
    566,
    826,
    248,
    866,
    950,
    626,
    949,
    687,
    217,
    815,
    67,
    104,
    58,
    512,
    24,
    892,
    894,
    767,
    553,
    81,
    379,
    843,
    831,
    445,
    742,
    717,
    958,
    743,
    527,
];
```

## Exercise 2

Given an Array of numbers and a number `k`, write a JavaScript program to check whether the sum of any two numbers from the list is equal to `k` or not.

For example, given `[1, 5, 11, 5]` and `k = 16`, return `true` since 11 + 5 is 16.

## Exercise 3

Write a JavaScript program to compute the largest product of three integers from a given list of integers.

## Exercise 4

Write a JavaScript program to multiply all the items in a list by the same value

## Exercise 5

Write a JavaScript program to multiply all the items in a list together

## Exercise 6

Write a JavaScript program to find the list of words that are longer than `n` from a given string.
