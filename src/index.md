title: Introduction to JavaScript
---

These notes introduce the JavaScript programming language. We focus on JavaScript as a general programming language itself, rather than looking at the use of JavaScript within webpages and using Web APIs to add dynamic and interactive content to webpages; this is covered in another course.

We look at the syntax and fundamental structures of the language and how we write JavaScript code to solve well understood problems.

## Further reading

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) has some good introductory articles on HTML and CSS. MDN is a very good resource for web developers, it covers a lot of web technologies in depth and is fairly reliable, though given recent changes in Mozilla, it is currently under threat. For now though, it still exists, and so MDN should be one of the first places you look for documentation/tutorials on web technologies.

In addition to the MDN tutorials and reference, Eloquent JavaScript is a really nice book that covers the language as well as using JavaScript on the web (both front-end and server-side), and you can read it all here:
