    <title>JavaScript Objects</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Open the Developer Tools Console to see the output of the JavaScript code.</p>
    <p>This example creates a simple Object in JavaScript. If you've seen Python, this looks a lot like defining a
        dictionary in that language. If you examine the Object in the console, you can see that it has the functions
        inherited from the Object prototype. We can also add functions to the Object</p>

            name: "Web Apps",
            lecturer: "Martin",
            students: []
        }

        cmt112.addStudent = function (student) {
            this.students.push(student);
